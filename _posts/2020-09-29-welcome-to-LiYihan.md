Welcome to **Liyihan's blog** !
{: .message }

I was born in Fuyang City, Anhui Province in 2002, and entered the software engineering program at the School of Software of Jilin University in 2020. My research interests are image generation and deep learning, and I am interested in working in the AIGC direction in the future.

**Scientific Research Experience**

> 2022 Study of dynamic multi-objective optimization problems
>
> ​      In-depth study and understanding of PSO, EA, GA and other classical algorithm ideas, using Matlab to reproduce several cutting-edge multi-objective optimization algorithm papers, able to use the evolutionary multi-objective optimization platform PlaEMO, design experiments, and compare and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of multi-objective algorithms.
>
> 2022 Greedy optimization of Monte Carlo algorithm games
>
> ​     According to the valuation function, the "bad solutions" are quickly eliminated and the "good solutions" are simulated in order by the greedy strategy idea. The optimization result is better than the traditional Monte Carlo method
> Ranked in the top 5% of the bot match ranking on the Peking University Zone matchmaking platform
>
> 2023 DCGAN-based image generation model
>
> ​     Construct a deep convolutional generative adversarial network implemented using pytorch, where the generator network gradually increases the image resolution by four layers of deconvolution, and the discriminator network uses four convolutional layers to bifurcate the image, generating close to the real image in a continuous adversarial training process.
